# Chrome Storage Implementation Investigation

## Current Implementation Analysis
1. File Structure:
   - manifest.json: Contains permissions and configuration
   - rules.json: Static blocklist
   - popup.js: Dynamic rule management
   - popup.html: User interface

2. Current Rule Management:
   - Static rules in rules.json (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
   - Dynamic rules via chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules
   - Rule ID management using counter
   - Error handling for API calls

## Chrome Storage API Analysis
1. Available Storage Types:
   - chrome.storage.sync: Syncs across devices (5MB limit)
   - chrome.storage.local: Device-specific (10MB limit)

2. Advantages of Chrome Storage:
   - Persistent across extension updates
   - Real-time synchronization (with sync storage)
   - Better for dynamic management
   - No need to bundle rules with extension
   - Built-in error handling

3. Required Changes:
   a) Storage Structure:
   ```javascript
   {
     "blockedSites": [
       {
         "domain": "twitter.com",
         "enabled": true,
         "addedAt": timestamp
       }
     ],
     "lastRuleId": number,
     "settings": {
       "syncEnabled": boolean,
       "notifyOnBlock": boolean
     }
   }
   ```

   b) Migration Path:
   - First launch: Import rules.json to storage
   - Convert storage data to declarativeNetRequest rules
   - Remove static rules.json dependency

4. Implementation Requirements:
   - Storage permission (already present)
   - Error handling for storage operations
   - Rule ID management system
   - Migration code for existing rules

5. Technical Considerations:
   - Storage operations are asynchronous
   - Need to handle race conditions
   - Consider quota limitations
   - Maintain backward compatibility

## Recommendations
1. Use chrome.storage.local:
   - Simpler implementation
   - No sync conflicts
   - Larger storage quota

2. Migration Strategy:
   - Keep rules.json as default template
   - Import on first run
   - Convert to storage format
   - Remove rules.json dependency

3. Error Handling:
   - Storage quota errors
   - API call failures
   - Network issues
   - Rule limit exceeded

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Storage operations
   - Rule conversion
   - Migration process
   - Error scenarios
