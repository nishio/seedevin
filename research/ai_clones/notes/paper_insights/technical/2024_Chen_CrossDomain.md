2. Cultural factors significantly influence adaptation requirements (p.6)
3. Technical architecture needs vary by application domain (p.8)
4. Implementation success rates show cultural variation (p.10)
5. Adaptive frameworks improve cross-domain applicability by 48% (p.12)
6. Domain-specific customization requirements identified (p.14)
7. Cultural background affects user acceptance patterns (p.16)
8. Framework for cross-domain implementation developed (p.18)
