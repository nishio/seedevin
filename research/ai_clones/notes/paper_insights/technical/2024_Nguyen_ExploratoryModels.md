## Key Insights
1. Trust development in human-AI teams follows distinct patterns based on interaction frequency and success rates (p.81)
2. Digital twins can effectively model individual differences in trust formation towards AI systems (p.83)
3. Team performance correlates strongly with trust alignment between human operators and AI agents (p.84)
4. Cultural background significantly influences initial trust baselines in human-AI teams (p.85)
5. Computational models can predict trust development trajectories with 78% accuracy (p.86)
6. Real-time trust assessment enables dynamic adjustment of AI behavior to maintain optimal team performance (p.87)
7. Trust repair mechanisms are essential for long-term human-AI team stability (p.88)
8. Individual personality traits affect trust development rates in human-AI interactions (p.89)
