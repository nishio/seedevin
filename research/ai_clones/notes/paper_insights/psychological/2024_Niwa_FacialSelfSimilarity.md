4. Uncanny valley effects emerge at specific self-similarity thresholds (p.9)
5. Cultural background influences acceptance of self-similar virtual agents (p.11)
6. Age-related variations in self-similarity preferences identified (p.13)
7. Emotional response patterns correlate with self-similarity levels (p.15)
8. Cross-cultural differences in uncanny valley thresholds observed (p.17)
