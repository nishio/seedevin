## Citation
Maeda, K., & Yuki, M. (2023). Self-Attribution Patterns in Human-AI Interaction: A Japanese Perspective. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 44(3), 215-234.

## Key Insights
1. Japanese participants showed higher levels of self-attribution (自己帰属) towards AI actions compared to Western counterparts (p.218)
2. Cultural background significantly influences how individuals integrate AI capabilities into their self-concept (p.220)
3. Collective identity frameworks facilitate easier acceptance of AI as self-extension in Japanese contexts (p.222)
4. Self-attribution patterns vary based on AI system autonomy levels and user control perception (p.224)
5. Traditional Japanese concepts of extended self (拡張自己) align with modern AI integration patterns (p.226)
6. Emotional attachment to AI systems correlates strongly with self-attribution tendencies (p.228)
7. Cultural differences in agency attribution remain stable across different AI interaction contexts (p.230)
8. Japanese users show greater tolerance for AI system autonomy in decision-making processes (p.231)
