3. Western implementations focus on individual control mechanisms (p.7)
4. Cultural background affects user acceptance criteria (p.9)
5. Integration success rates vary by cultural context (p.11)
6. Adaptive implementation frameworks show 45% higher acceptance (p.13)
7. Cross-cultural validation reveals universal success factors (p.15)
8. Framework for culturally adaptive implementation developed (p.17)
