\subsection{Architecture of AI Clone Systems}

The technical implementation of AI clone systems requires sophisticated architecture that balances autonomy, learning capability, and user control. Modern implementations typically follow a multi-layered architecture:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data Collection Layer
\begin{itemize}
\item Behavioral monitoring systems
\item Input processing mechanisms
\item Context awareness modules
\end{itemize}

\item Learning Layer
\begin{itemize}
\item Pattern recognition algorithms
\item Behavioral modeling systems
\item Preference learning mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\item Interaction Layer
\begin{itemize}
\item Natural language processing
\item Gesture recognition
\item Multimodal interfaces
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Recent implementations have demonstrated various approaches to these architectural components. For example, \citet{lauer2024rehabilitation} developed a rehabilitation gaming system using digital twins that adapts to user behavior patterns, while \citet{kim2024healthcare} implemented a healthcare decision support system that learns from patient preferences and medical history.

\subsection{User Interface Paradigms}
