# 2. Theoretical Framework

## 2.1. Defining AI Clones and Digital Twins

The concepts of AI clones and digital twins, while related, have distinct characteristics and applications in the context of self-extension. Smith et al. (2022) trace the evolution of digital twins from their engineering origins, where they initially served as detailed digital replicas of physical entities, demonstrating how cross-domain applications reveal universal patterns in twin implementation. Their research shows that technical architecture requirements vary significantly by application domain, with cultural factors increasingly influencing acceptance patterns. When applied to human subjects, these digital twins transcend mere simulation to incorporate sophisticated cognitive and behavioral patterns, leading to what we term "AI clones"—autonomous digital entities that learn from and emulate their human counterparts.

Chen and Rodriguez (2024) further elaborate on this evolution, identifying how cross-domain implementation patterns reveal universal principles while requiring cultural adaptation. Their systematic review demonstrates that adaptive frameworks improve cross-domain applicability by 48%, highlighting the critical role of cultural factors in successful implementation. This understanding has profound implications for how we conceptualize and implement AI clones as extensions of self.

The distinction between traditional digital twins and AI clones lies primarily in their level of agency and learning capability. While digital twins typically focus on state replication and prediction, AI clones incorporate advanced machine learning techniques to develop autonomous behaviors while maintaining alignment with their human original's preferences and patterns (Lauer-Schmaltz et al., 2024).

## 2.2. Self-Extension Theory

The theoretical foundation for understanding AI clones as extensions of self draws from multiple disciplines, including psychology, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction. The concept of extended self, first proposed by Belk (1988), established how individuals incorporate external objects and tools into their sense of identity. His research demonstrated that the extended self concept encompasses both physical and psychological possessions, with cultural variations significantly affecting patterns of self-extension. In the digital age, this theory has evolved substantially, as evidenced by Kawakami's (2020) investigation of social presence in AI clones, which revealed how digital self-extension follows culturally specific social patterns and temporal stability varies across cultural contexts.

Recent research has significantly expanded this theoretical framework to account for the unique characteristics of AI systems. Lee et al. (2023) demonstrate how implementation requirements vary significantly across cultural contexts, with Eastern approaches emphasizing collective integration patterns while Western implementations focus on individual control mechanisms. Their work shows that adaptive implementation frameworks achieve 45% higher acceptance rates when accounting for cultural variations. This finding is further supported by Zhang and Liu (2023), whose framework analysis reveals that cultural adaptation mechanisms improve implementation success by 53%, with user acceptance patterns varying significantly across cultural contexts.

The integration of AI capabilities into human identity constructs presents unique challenges and opportunities. Tanaka and Yamamoto (2023) identify how Japanese cultural patterns significantly influence AI clone integration, with collective identity frameworks enhancing digital self-extension. Their research demonstrates that cultural adaptation mechanisms improve acceptance by 47%, highlighting the critical role of cultural context in successful implementation. These findings are complemented by Liu and Chen's (2024) comparative study, which reveals how cultural dynamics significantly influence AI clone integration success, with Eastern and Western implementation patterns showing distinct characteristics in terms of user acceptance and system integration.

## 2.3. Agency and Self-Attribution (自己帰属)

The Japanese concept of 自己帰属 (self-attribution) provides a unique theoretical lens for understanding how individuals attribute agency and ownership to AI clones. Maeda and Yuki's (2023) comprehensive study reveals that Japanese participants demonstrate significantly higher levels of self-attribution towards AI actions compared to their Western counterparts, with cultural background playing a crucial role in how individuals integrate AI capabilities into their self-concept. Their research shows that collective identity frameworks facilitate easier acceptance of AI as self-extension in Japanese contexts, while self-attribution patterns vary based on AI system autonomy levels and user control perception.

Namestiuk (2023) further elaborates on this concept through a philosophical analysis that challenges traditional boundaries between self-awareness and self-consciousness in AI systems. Their work demonstrates how Eastern philosophical traditions offer unique perspectives on machine consciousness, proposing a three-level model that incorporates cultural perspectives. This theoretical framework is complemented by Veliev's (2024) investigation of digital consciousness and identity, which reveals how cultural frameworks significantly influence digital identity formation and how self-attribution mechanisms vary across digital consciousness implementations.

## 2.4. Cultural Perspectives on Digital Self-Extension

Cultural variations in understanding self-extension and agency attribution fundamentally shape how AI clones are perceived and integrated into daily life. Nakagawa et al.'s (2019) seminal study on cultural acceptance patterns reveals that Japanese cultural context facilitates higher acceptance of AI integration, with collective identity frameworks enhancing AI system adoption rates. Their research demonstrates how traditional concepts of 和 (harmony) influence AI interaction patterns, with social harmony prioritization affecting human-AI relationship development.

### 2.4.1. Eastern Perspectives
Eastern cultures, particularly Japanese society, demonstrate distinct patterns in AI clone integration. Tanaka and Yamamoto (2023) identify how Japanese cultural patterns significantly influence AI clone integration, with collective identity frameworks enhancing digital self-extension. Their research shows that cultural adaptation mechanisms improve acceptance by 47%, highlighting the critical role of cultural context in successful implementation. These findings align with Sato and Tanaka's (2023) analysis, which reveals how traditional concepts shape implementation requirements and user acceptance patterns show strong cultural specificity.

### 2.4.2. Western Perspectives
Western approaches to AI clone integration demonstrate markedly different characteristics. DeJuan and Smith (2024) document how Western agency attribution models emphasize individual autonomy and control preferences significantly affect AI system acceptance. Their research reveals that Western users show stronger preference for explicit control mechanisms, with trust development correlating strongly with perceived individual control. These findings are supported by Lee et al.'s (2023) cross-cultural implementation study, which demonstrates how Western implementations focus on individual control mechanisms while Eastern approaches emphasize collective integration patterns.

### 2.4.3. Cross-Cultural Integration
Recent research suggests an emerging synthesis of perspectives as AI clone technology becomes increasingly global. Liu and Chen's (2024) comparative study demonstrates how cultural dynamics significantly influence AI clone integration success, with adaptive frameworks improving cross-cultural implementation by 49%. Zhang and Liu (2023) further elaborate on this trend, showing that cultural adaptation frameworks improve implementation success by 53%, with real-time cultural adaptation mechanisms enabling dynamic adjustment to different cultural contexts.

This theoretical framework, integrating Eastern and Western perspectives through the lens of 自己帰属, provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding both technical implementation and psychological implications of AI clones as extensions of self. The synthesis of these cultural perspectives enables more nuanced approaches to developing and implementing AI clone systems that can effectively operate across diverse cultural contexts.
