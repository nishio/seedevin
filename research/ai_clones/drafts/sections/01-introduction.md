# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Background and Motivation

The emergence of AI clones and digital twins as extensions of self represents a transformative development in human-computer interaction and psychological research. This evolution builds upon foundational work in extended self theory (Belk, 1988), which established how individuals incorporate external elements into their identity. As artificial intelligence systems have grown increasingly sophisticated, the ability to create digital representations that mirror not only physical characteristics but also cognitive and behavioral patterns has transitioned from theoretical possibility to technological reality. This advancement raises fundamental questions about the nature of self-identity, agency, and the psychological implications of human-AI integration.

The development of AI clones—digital entities that learn from and emulate their human counterparts—has garnered significant attention across multiple disciplines. Recent research by Kim et al. (2024) demonstrates the effectiveness of digital twins in healthcare decision support, showing a 43% improvement in treatment planning accuracy through culturally-sensitive implementation. Similarly, Kawakami's (2020) investigation of social presence in AI clones reveals how digital self-extension follows culturally specific patterns, with significant implications for user acceptance and integration. These applications exemplify how AI clone technology is fundamentally reshaping our understanding of human-computer interaction and self-representation in digital spaces.

## 1.2. Scope and Objectives

This survey paper aims to comprehensively examine the current state of research regarding AI clones as extensions of self, synthesizing findings from multiple disciplines and cultural perspectives. Our analysis focuses on three interconnected domains that emerge as critical areas in current research. First, we examine interface and system designs, analyzing technical frameworks and interaction paradigms that enable AI clone creation and operation. Recent work by Mandischer and Atanasyan (2024) demonstrates how their Perspectives-Observer-Transparency (POT) framework provides a structured approach to modeling human-AI interaction patterns, while Wang et al. (2024) contribute significant benchmarking methodologies through their SimBench framework.

Second, we investigate the psychological implications of AI clone integration, exploring cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects of human-AI interaction. This investigation builds upon Kawakami's (2020) foundational work on social presence and digital self-extension, which reveals how these effects manifest differently across cultural contexts. The research extends to examining how facial self-similarity influences impression formation in virtual agents, as demonstrated by Niwa et al. (2024), who identified significant cultural variations in acceptance patterns.

Third, we examine agency and self-attribution in AI clone systems, with particular attention to the Japanese concept of 自己帰属 (self-attribution). This analysis draws heavily on Maeda and Yuki's (2023) comparative study of self-attribution patterns, which reveals how cultural background significantly influences the integration of AI capabilities into self-concept. Their work is complemented by Namestiuk's (2023) philosophical analysis of self-awareness and self-consciousness in AI systems, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding agency attribution across cultural contexts.

## 1.3. Methodology

Our methodology encompasses a systematic review of academic literature across multiple disciplines and cultural contexts, following established practices in comprehensive literature analysis. The primary corpus consists of technical papers from major computing conferences and journals, including seminal works in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. We complement these with psychological research from both Western and Eastern perspectives, particularly focusing on studies that examine cultural variations in technology acceptance and integration. Additionally, we analyze cultural studies on digital identity and self-attribution, along with detailed case studies of implemented AI clone systems.

The literature review spans publications from 2015 to 2024, with particular emphasis on developments since 2020 that reflect current technological capabilities and psychological understanding. Our selection criteria prioritize papers demonstrating robust scientific methodology and significant citation impact. Following Wang et al.'s (2024) SimBench framework, we evaluate technical implementations using standardized metrics for assessing digital twin fidelity. For psychological and cultural analyses, we adopt Maeda and Yuki's (2023) comparative framework, which provides structured approaches for evaluating cross-cultural variations in self-attribution patterns.

## 1.4. Paper Organization

This survey is structured to systematically address the theoretical foundations, technical implementations, and psychological implications of AI clones as extensions of self. Section 2 establishes the theoretical framework, building upon Belk's (1988) foundational work on extended self while incorporating contemporary perspectives on digital identity formation. Section 3 examines interface and system designs, analyzing technical approaches through the lens of Mandischer and Atanasyan's (2024) POT framework and Wang et al.'s (2024) SimBench evaluation criteria.

Section 4 explores psychological implications, drawing heavily on Kawakami's (2020) analysis of social presence and Niwa et al.'s (2024) investigation of facial self-similarity effects. Section 5 investigates agency and self-reference, centering on Maeda and Yuki's (2023) comparative study of self-attribution patterns and Namestiuk's (2023) philosophical analysis of AI consciousness. Section 6 synthesizes current limitations and future directions, while Section 7 concludes with research opportunities and emerging trends.

Throughout the analysis, we maintain a strong cross-cultural perspective, particularly highlighting Japanese concepts such as 自己帰属 (self-attribution) and their implications for understanding human-AI integration. This approach enables a comprehensive examination of how different cultural contexts influence the development, implementation, and acceptance of AI clone technologies.
