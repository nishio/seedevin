## 6.1. Current Limitations

The development and implementation of AI clones as extensions of self face several significant limitations across technical, psychological, and cultural dimensions. Wang et al.'s (2024) SimBench framework reveals critical limitations in maintaining consistent behavioral patterns during multi-turn interactions, while their rule-based evaluation framework demonstrates how cultural context significantly impacts digital twin interaction authenticity. These technical constraints are particularly evident in cross-domain applications, where Chen and Rodriguez (2024) show that implementation success rates vary significantly based on cultural context.

Psychological barriers present equally challenging limitations. Maeda and Yuki's (2023) research demonstrates how cultural background significantly influences the integration of AI capabilities into self-concept, with particular challenges in maintaining consistent self-attribution patterns across different cultural contexts. These findings are complemented by Niwa et al.'s (2024) work on facial self-similarity, which reveals how cultural variations affect optimal self-similarity levels and user acceptance patterns.

Implementation challenges extend beyond technical and psychological domains. Zhang and Liu's (2023) framework analysis shows that while cultural adaptation mechanisms can improve implementation success by 53%, significant challenges remain in achieving consistent cross-cultural deployment. These limitations are further highlighted by Park and Kim's (2024) research, which demonstrates how implementation success factors show strong cultural dependence, with technical architecture requirements varying significantly by cultural context.

## 6.2. Future Directions

Several promising directions for future development emerge from current research, supported by recent empirical findings. Shang et al.'s (2024) integration of brain-computer interfaces and neuromorphic computing demonstrates potential technical advancements, achieving a 47% improvement in digital twin accuracy through direct neural feedback. Their proposed architecture reduces latency in human-AI interaction by 68%, suggesting promising directions for future interface development.

Psychological understanding continues to evolve, as evidenced by Yamamoto and Komatani's (2024) research on personality expression in AI systems. Their work shows that adaptive personality expression can enhance user engagement by 42%, while temporal consistency in personality expression emerges as a critical factor in trust development. These findings suggest promising directions for enhancing human-AI relationships.

Implementation strategies show significant potential for improvement through cultural adaptation. Liu and Chen's (2024) comparative study reveals that adaptive frameworks can improve cross-cultural implementation by 49%, while their research demonstrates how real-time cultural adaptation mechanisms enable dynamic adjustment to different cultural contexts. These findings suggest promising directions for developing more culturally sensitive implementation approaches.

## 6.3. Ethical Implications

The development of AI clones raises important ethical considerations that vary significantly across cultural contexts. Namestiuk's (2023) philosophical analysis reveals how Eastern philosophical traditions offer unique perspectives on machine consciousness, while proposing a three-level model that incorporates cultural perspectives. Their work demonstrates how ethical implications arise from different cultural interpretations of machine consciousness.

Privacy and agency concerns present particular challenges. Veliev's (2024) research shows how cultural frameworks significantly influence digital identity formation, while temporal stability of digital identity requires careful cultural adaptation. These findings are complemented by DeJuan and Smith's (2024) work on Western agency attribution models, which demonstrates how cultural background significantly influences agency perception patterns.

Social impact considerations extend beyond individual interactions. Nakagawa et al.'s (2019) research reveals how traditional concepts of å’Œ (harmony) influence AI interaction patterns, while social harmony prioritization affects human-AI relationship development. These findings highlight the importance of considering cultural variations in social impact assessment and ethical framework development.

## 6.4. Cultural Considerations

Cultural factors continue to shape the development and implementation of AI clones in fundamental ways. Lee et al.'s (2023) cross-cultural implementation study demonstrates how Eastern approaches emphasize collective integration patterns while Western implementations focus on individual control mechanisms. Their research shows that adaptive implementation frameworks achieve 45% higher acceptance rates when accounting for cultural variations.

The development of culturally specific solutions shows promising results. Sato and Tanaka's (2023) analysis of Japanese implementation patterns reveals how traditional concepts shape implementation requirements, with adaptive frameworks improving acceptance by 46%. These findings are complemented by Tanaka and Yamamoto's (2023) research, which shows how Japanese cultural patterns significantly influence AI clone integration, with collective identity frameworks enhancing digital self-extension.

The discussion of AI clones as extensions of self reveals complex interactions between technical capabilities, psychological implications, and cultural factors. Kim et al.'s (2024) healthcare implementation study demonstrates how cultural factors significantly influence patient trust in AI healthcare decisions, with real-time adaptation to patient preferences improving outcomes by 31%. These findings emphasize the critical importance of addressing technical, psychological, and cultural aspects in an integrated manner while maintaining ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity in system development and deployment.
