## Key Concepts

### Plurality and Decentralized Society
- DeSoc represents a "co-determined sociality" where communities emerge bottom-up
- Focuses on non-transferable relationships and trust networks
- Uses "soulbound" tokens (SBTs) to represent commitments and credentials
- Aims to create plural network goods and intelligences at various scales

### Implementation Mechanisms
- Quadratic funding with correlation scores
- Trust-based governance systems
- Community wallet recovery
- Sybil-resistant governance

### Mass Adaptation Challenges
- Current web3 focus on transferable, financialized assets
- Need for trust networks in economic activities
- Protection against capture and extraction
- Balance between cooperation and network protection

### Trial-and-Error Processes
- Evolution from pure financial tokens to relationship-based tokens
- Development of correlation scoring mechanisms
- Implementation of community-based recovery systems

### Real-World Applications
- Uncollateralized lending
- Personal brand building
- Community governance
- Decentralized identity systems

## Key Quotes

> "Web3 today centers around expressing transferable, financialized assets, rather than encoding social relationships of trust. Yet many core economic activities—such as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands—are built on persistent, non-transferable relationships."

> "We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem 'Decentralized Society' (DeSoc)—a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales."

## Implementation Progress
- Current Stage: Theoretical framework with some early implementations
- Key Challenges:
  1. Building trust networks at scale
  2. Preventing system gaming
  3. Balancing privacy with transparency
  4. Ensuring inclusive participation

## Research Questions
1. How can SBTs be implemented while preserving privacy?
2. What mechanisms prevent centralization in DeSoc?
3. How can quadratic funding be scaled effectively?
4. What role do correlation scores play in preventing collusion?

## Next Steps for Research
- [ ] Analyze real-world implementations of SBTs
- [ ] Study correlation between QF and community engagement
- [ ] Examine privacy preservation techniques
- [ ] Investigate governance mechanism effectiveness
