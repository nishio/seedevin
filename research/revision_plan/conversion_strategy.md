# Paper Revision Strategy

## Section-by-Section Analysis and Plan

### 1. Introduction
Current state: Mostly prose with some bullet points
Research notes to incorporate: None needed (already in proper format)
Action needed: Minor refinement of existing prose

### 2. Theoretical Framework
Current state: Bullet-pointed structure throughout
Research notes to incorporate: 
- desoc_paper_notes.md for theoretical foundations
- vtaiwan_notes.md for practical implementation theory
Action needed: Convert all subsections to flowing paragraphs

### 3. Implementation Mechanisms
Current state: Mixed format with detailed bullet points
Research notes to incorporate:
- polis_implementation.md
- community_notes_analysis.md
- quadratic_mechanisms.md
- qv_implementation_cases.md
- qf_implementation.md
Action needed: Restructure into cohesive narrative paragraphs

### 4. Mass Adaptation Analysis
Current state: Heavily bullet-pointed
Research notes to incorporate:
- taiwan_digital_democracy.md
- community_notes_analysis.md (adoption metrics)
- qv_implementation_cases.md (adoption patterns)
Action needed: Complete prose conversion with implementation examples

### 5. Case Studies
Current state: Structured bullet points
Research notes to incorporate:
- taiwan_digital_democracy.md
- desoc_paper_notes.md
Action needed: Transform into narrative case study format

### 6. Future Directions
Current state: Extensive bullet-point structure
Research notes to incorporate:
- All implementation notes for future challenges
- Cross-reference with current challenges
Action needed: Convert to flowing discussion of future possibilities

### 7. Conclusion
Current state: Semi-structured with bullet points
Research notes to incorporate:
- Synthesis of all implementation findings
Action needed: Enhance narrative flow and strengthen connections

## Citation Strategy
1. Primary Sources:
   - Buterin, Hitzig, Weyl (2018) for Quadratic mechanisms
   - Weyl, Ohlhaver, Buterin (2022) for DeSoc framework
   - vTaiwan documentation for practical implementation
   - Community Notes technical documentation

2. Implementation Examples:
   - Colorado QV implementation
   - Gitcoin Grants data
   - vTaiwan success metrics
   - Community Notes adoption statistics

3. Theoretical Framework:
   - Democratic theory references
   - Mechanism design papers
   - Digital democracy literature

## Revision Process
1. Section-by-Section Approach:
   - Start with Introduction (minimal changes needed)
   - Focus on Implementation Mechanisms (most critical section)
   - Progress through remaining sections
   - End with Conclusion refinement

2. Citation Integration:
   - Add inline citations throughout
   - Ensure proper citation format
   - Cross-reference implementation examples
   - Maintain academic rigor

3. Quality Control:
   - Verify narrative flow
   - Check citation consistency
   - Ensure proper academic tone
   - Maintain logical progression

## Additional Research Needed
1. Democratic Theory:
   - Additional background on digital democracy evolution
   - Historical context for mechanism design

2. Implementation Cases:
   - More recent vTaiwan implementations
   - Updated Community Notes statistics
   - Latest Quadratic Funding applications

3. Future Directions:
   - Recent developments in mechanism design
   - Emerging implementation patterns
   - New technical challenges

## Writing Style Guidelines
1. Academic Tone:
   - Use formal language throughout
   - Avoid colloquialisms
   - Maintain objective perspective
   - Support claims with citations

2. Paragraph Structure:
   - Clear topic sentences
   - Supporting evidence
   - Logical transitions
   - Concluding statements

3. Citation Format:
   - Use consistent citation style
   - Include page numbers where applicable
   - Cross-reference related sections
   - Maintain comprehensive bibliography

This strategy will guide our revision process to transform the current bullet-pointed structure into proper academic prose with comprehensive citations.
